# SCAT-ethereum
 we propose a smart contracts-based scheme that supports anonymous transactions, where the relationship between transaction senders and receivers and the transaction amounts are all hidden. Specifically, we use \textit{mixing contracts} and zero-knowledge proofs to protect transaction amounts and provide an off-chain \textit{anonymity provider mechanism} to hide the identity of  real users by using some fake users. Besides, to hide users' behavior of participating in transactions, we design \textit{proxy call contracts services} in agents to call contracts for users. The security and performance analysis show that our work provides users privacy and funds security and can be completed within an acceptable cost.

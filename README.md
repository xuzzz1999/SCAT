# SCAT-ethereum
 we propose a smart contracts-based scheme that supports anonymous transactions, where the relationship between transaction senders and receivers and the transaction amounts are all hidden. Specifically, we use mixing contracts and zero-knowledge proofs to protect transaction amounts and provide an off-chain anonymity provider mechanism to hide the identity of  real users by using some fake users. Besides, to hide users' behavior of participating in transactions, we design proxy call contracts services in agents to call contracts for users. The security and performance analysis show that our work provides users privacy and funds security and can be completed within an acceptable cost.
